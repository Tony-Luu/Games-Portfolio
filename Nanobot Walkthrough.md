Walkthrough

The player starts with three functions for the nanobots: Devour, Hook, and Shield. The destructible objects in front of the player at the start allows the player to test and 
see which of those nanobot functions remove the obstacles. This would teach the player which nanobot function will remove destructible obstacles later in the game. In the middle 
of the room, there are two colored doors and one another corridor leading to a room. Since the colored doors requires keys to open, this would guide the player towards the corridor.
The corridor leading to the room is blocked by destructible cubes. Since the player has learned that the devour nanobot function is the one to destroy destructible objects, then 
the player simply has to destroy their way through to obtain the purple keycard. Once the player unlocks the purple door, the player is lead into another room with more obstacles.

This time, the player has to figure out a way to traverse through the environment with other nanobot functions to avoid the colored lasers. Touching the lasers will kill the player
and send the player back to the entrance of the room. There are hooks located above the frame of the roof and one of the nanobot functions is a hook. The player can traverse 
through the room with the hook function as long as there is a hook above to travel over the lasers.

There are boxes located throughout the room which the player has to pick up and drop on the colored switches on the floor. Pressing the switch by landing the box on it will 
deactivate the respective colored laser for example, pressing the cyan colored switch will deactivate the cyan colored laser. You can pick up the box and use the hook at the same 
time. Once the player has deactivated the cyan colored laser, they can see a box blocking the laser. This gives the player a clue that the laser can be blocked which can be used 
to proceed through the room and avoid being killed. The player could also use the Shield nanobot function to block the laser in the middle as the box is blocking the lower laser 
allowing the player to go through without harm. 

When the player pasts through, there will be destructible boxes blocking lasers. Since there are clues that the boxes block out the lasers but using the devour nanobot function 
would remove the boxes, the player must be careful to not destroy all of the destructible boxes and only provide just enough space to pass through. The last obstacle in the room 
are filled with spikes and platforms on top with the hooks above. The player must use all of the clues and the appropriate nanobot functions to traverse through the end of the room
and obtain the orange keycard.
