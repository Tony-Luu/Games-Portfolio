  <b>About Me</b>
</p>
I'm a Computer Games Development graduate from University of East London with a passion for games development and programming. This portfolio demonstrates a variety of gameplay features implemented in these projects to generate interesting gameplay. My passion for gaming first began since childhood as the first few games I have ever played
were Pokemon Gold, Final Fantasy 4, and Age of Empires. From that point onwards, it has
shaped my tastes for those genres. I eventually discovered free hobbyist game creation
software such as RPG Maker 2000 and Game Maker. This got me into games development
because I have thoroughly enjoyed the freedom and expression of creating unique gameplay
experiences.

#### Note: Due to the project using Wwise Unity, it is incompatible with WebGL so therefore there is no WebGL build. Instead, a download link containing a PC build is provided for those who are interested in playing the game.

Polar is a 3D game project made during the Games Parade Spring 2021 hosted from a Discord community called Games Jobs Live which is a games development community. This gamejam lasted from 21st February to 28th February. The theme for this particular gamejam was "Strength lies in differences" and I teamed up with four other people composed of another programmer, artist, designer, and sound designer. My responsibility within the team was to implement the various character abilities.

Calor is a 2D game project made during the Winter GameJam 2020 hosted from a Discord community called Game Dev London which started as a games development meetup in London many years ago. This gamejam lasted from 27th November to 6th December so the event lasted for an entire week and approximately had 40 hours to create a game. The theme for this was called "Warmth" so I teamed up in a group of 6 (including myself) to brainstorm various ideas associated with the word to generate interesting ideas. My responsbility in the team was to implement gameplay mechanics, controls, and include all of the art and sound assets my team created for this game.

Infinite Defender is a throwback to the old-fashioned arcade space-shooting games with a twist. Enemy waves are procedurally-generated so they spawn differently every time you play it. The waves continuously spawn until the player dies so survive as long as you can and earn a high score. This 2D project was made solo and it is intended for the Android devices and smartphones. This game involved a lot of design decisions and iterations as well as learning how to use maths functions to create a sine wave pattern movement and the circular motion for the enemy spaceships. The design iterations mostly consisted of gameplay rebalances and player experiences. Click on the link above this description to read on further.

This is a 2D adventure game where the player has to explore around the world to collect rare treasures and collectibles. The challenges contained in this game are grid-based. This project was made by four people: Jane Perry (worked on the 2D art style, environments and characters), Jason Wong (created the 2D icons for the nodes), David Nguyen (coded the procedural generation of the node map and event manager) and Tony Luu. This game was intended for Android devices as well as smartphones. Click on the link above to read more about how I devised solutions for the problems I have encountered.

Walkthrough: [Link](https://github.com/Tony-Luu/Games-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/Nanobot%20Walkthrough.md){:target="_blank"}

This project was made as my coursework for one of my modules. Nanobots is a 3rd person puzzle platforming game where the player has to traverse through the environment using nanobots. My lecturer had a discussion about using dynamic elements such as particle effects, physics, textures, lights, and sound in an unconventional way. I mainly used particle effects to represent the different functions of nanobots. The walkthrough for this game is at the link above this description.

- At 00:03, I used a particle effect to collide with the destructible obstacle to reduce the size of it until they are destroyed.

- At 00:48, the particle effect I have used has a different function called "Hook" which lets the player pull towards the hook. The cube object can be picked up and placed on buttons as a weight, block laser particles or used as an extra platform.

- At 2:31, I used textures to implement this memory puzzle which randomly creates a sequence of flashing colours which the player must click on the correct sequence to progress through. The material for the flashing textures uses a normal map, a height map, and illumin properties to create the sequence of flashing colours.

- At 2:52, the torch light uses a raycast that hits the invisible platform on the ground which decreases the transparency of the material on the platform.

This game was created by 7 members for a group project during university. Lunar Odyssey is a 2D endless survival game where the player has to avoid obstacles created by the Greek gods. Use the mouse to drag the moon vertically up and down to control the ocean waves and drag the boat left to right would move the boat horizontally. I have used what I have learned from the module called Games Studio to implement obstacles by using Unity components such as:

- The volcano spewing up fiery rocks at 0:49 had the rigidbody component attached to it to fall from the sky and collide with the ship which causes damage if it hits.

- The cyclops picking up the boulder and throwing it above himself at 1:40 uses the rigidbody component to animate the boulder being picked up and thrown at the ship would collide with the ship if it hits.

- The kraken's tentacle attack at 2:27 has both a collider and a rigidbody component which can cause damage if the tentacles hit the ship.

- The lightning cloud at spawned at 3:18 has a particle effect with a lightning texture attached to it which can collide with the ship.
